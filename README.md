# Labb2.CV

## INTRODUCTION
This is a school project to create a CV-page.

## ABOUT THE APPLICATION
The CV-page has been created with HTML, Css and JavaScript.

## AVAILABILITY
I have made the site as available as possible. I think the page is easy to navigate with a clear menu and headlines which makes it easy to percieve information on the page. For the pictures I have added and alternative text if the pictures wouldn't load.

## SEMANTIC
I have used semantic tags such as header, nav, main, section, article and footer as much as possible. There are a few occasions I have used div, for example the easter eggs.
