## ABOUT THE APPLICATION
The CV-page has been created with HTML, Css and JavaScript.

## AVAILABILITY
I have made the site as available as possible. I think the page is easy to navigate with a clear menu and headlines which makes it easy to percieve information on the page. For the pictures I have added and alternative text if the pictures wouldn't load.

## SEMANTIC
I have used semantic tags such as header, nav, main, section, article and footer as much as possible. There are a few occasions I have used div, for example the easter eggs. 

## RESPONSIVE
The page is responsive and the information can be read even on the smallest screen I could find which was Galaxy fold. I have used media to adapt the page content when the width is smaller than 1024px. I have chosen 1024px since the width of the navigation bar will not fit to the screen and the normal layout of the page didn't work as well on a Nest Hub screen. I have used Flex to adapt the content on the page. The menu could be better with a hamnurger menu which you could open and close. But I think it works now as I have made the menu to go in column direction for smaller screens and the text and padding is less so it doesn't take over the small screen.
